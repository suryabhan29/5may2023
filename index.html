            <img src="./img/3.png" />
            <p>IPL 2023 CSK vs MI Live Score: MS Dhoni won the toss and chose to bowl first. Rohit Sharma has said that Tilak Varma misses out due to a niggle and Tristan Stubbs replaces him. Chennai Super Kings have earned just a point from the last three games, and are looking to get their campaign back on track when they host a resurgent Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League here on Saturday. The four-time champions will, however, be wary of MI, which has a superior record at MA Chidambaram stadium here and has claimed victories in the last two matches. The Mahendra Singh Dhoni-led Super Kings lost the two matches they played against five-time champions MI in 2019 and will be playing their arch-rivals at home after nearly four years. CSK head into Saturday's game on the back of a rained off fixture (vs LSG) and two losses.</p>
